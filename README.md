This is a project I completed for The Odin Project curriculum. I was given an image with a sample sign up form and instructed to create my own version based solely on what I could see in the image. No help/instruction was given on the code. 

This project grew my knowledge of HTML forms, as well as built my skills with CSS and Javascript. Some notable learning highlights of this project include:

    -- Using media queries to make form responsive.
    -- Using position relative and position absolute to layer elements on top of one another.
    -- Using Javascript to allow user to show their password.

I really enjoyed this project and hope to work on more like it in the future!
